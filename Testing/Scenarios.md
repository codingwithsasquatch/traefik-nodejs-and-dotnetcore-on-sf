## What are the Scenarios we're testing?

# Scenario 1 - Large number of Apps/Services in Cluster

When Traefik is running in a cluster with a large number of Apps and Services does it function correctly. Capture the following metrics with a low and a high number of apps and compare the difference.  

Metrics - the time take for:
- A property override to become effective 
- An added service to become routable
- Provider update to take place

# Scenario 2 - Large number of requests 

When Traefik is hit with large volumes of traffic does it handle them well?
